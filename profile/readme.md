# IT with Lyam Official
**Welcome to the IT with Lyam profile. This is the official organisation for my business IT with Lyam. I enjoy emulating (recreating on a computer) different things, for example a CPU and a nuclear reactor. I also like large projects. My most common programming language that I use in these projects is JavaScript (NodeJS). Also, please note I can only work on one repository at a time so there might be gaps in changes across my profile.**
